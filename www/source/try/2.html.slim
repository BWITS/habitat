h2.page-body--title Ask the Supervisor What's Configurable

p
  | One powerful aspect of Habitat is that services are managed by a
    <a href="/docs/concepts-supervisor/">Supervisor</a>. The Supervisor handles
    many things including, as we'll see here, reporting on what is configurable
    within our running service.
p
  | From the beginning, Habitat was built with configuration in mind. Instead
    of constantly destroying, re-building and re-deploying packages for each
    change, Habitat produces an immutable package artifact with common
    configuration settings exposed via the Supervisor.

code
  | hab sup config core/redis

= partial "partials/terminal" do

#success
  = partial "partials/advance_button" do
    | Next - Make a configuration change

= link_to "/try/", :class => "back-link" do
  | Back to previous step
